Linear regression is a statistical method used to study the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the response or outcome variable) and one or more independent variables (also called predictors or explanatory variables). The assumptions of linear regression include:

## 1. Linearity:
 The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables is linear. In other words, the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables.

## 2. Independence: 
  The observations are independent of each other. That is, the value of the dependent variable for one observation does not affect the value of the dependent variable for another observation.

## 3. Homoscedasticity: 
  The variance of the dependent variable is constant across different levels of the independent variables. In other words, the scatter of the residuals (the difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable) is roughly constant across all values of the independent variables.

## 4. Normality: 
  The distribution of the residuals is normal. In other words, the residuals follow a bell-shaped curve.

## 5. No multicollinearity: 
There is no perfect linear relationship between the independent variables. That is, the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.
